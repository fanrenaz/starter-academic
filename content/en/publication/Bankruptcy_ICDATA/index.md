abstract: This study generates data mining models to predict corporate bankruptcy in Poland and China, and then examines these models to determine the financial characteristics that are of the greatest predictive value. These financial features are then compared for the two countries. The study finds that there while there are some common financial indicators for bankruptcy between the two diverse financial markets, there are also key differences. In particular, asset-related features play a much larger role in predicting bankruptcy in China, while operations-related features play a larger role in predicting bankruptcy in Poland.
